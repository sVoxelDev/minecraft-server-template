# WEPIF Configuration File
#
# This file handles permissions configuration for every plugin using WEPIF
#
# About editing this file:
# - DO NOT USE TABS. You MUST use spaces or Bukkit will complain. If
#   you use an editor like Notepad++ (recommended for Windows users), you
#   must configure it to "replace tabs with spaces." In Notepad++, this can
#   be changed in Settings > Preferences > Language Menu.
# - Don't get rid of the indents. They are indented so some entries are
#   in categories (like "enforce-single-session" is in the "protection"
#   category.
# - If you want to check the format of this file before putting it
#   into WEPIF, paste it into https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
#   and see if it gives "ERROR:".
# - Lines starting with # are comments and so they are ignored.
